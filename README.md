# Data-Driven Donor Segmentation & CLV Modelling

## 📌 Project Overview
This project applies **machine learning and statistical analysis** to a dataset of **24,000+ donor records** from a charity telemarketing campaign.  
The goal is to **optimise fundraising strategies** by identifying high-value donor segments, predicting donation behaviour, and calculating **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**.

The work was developed and presented in an **inter-university hackathon**, where it secured **3rd place** for actionable business insights and strategic recommendations.

## 🔑 Key Objectives
- Analyse donor demographics, campaign outcomes, and payment behaviour.  
- Build predictive models (linear regression, tree-based models) to explain donation size.  
- Perform **clustering analysis** to identify donor personas.  
- Calculate **Donor Lifetime Value (CLV)** to prioritise high-value donors.  
- Translate findings into **business implications for telemarketing** strategies.
